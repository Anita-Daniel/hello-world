# About me

Hi, I am Anita Daniel. Of course you know that from my user name. I am a young adult who is vebnturing into learning how to code so I can become a develop. Learning is what I love to do every day be it through a quick conversation with some on the train or at my worstation in the bank hall or over the internet. I feel weird about typing descriptions to be honest. But I am happy to start this journey!
